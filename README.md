Here even when I tried to check with the help of convnets I found that the accuracy was to improve about 70 percent but when I tried to check it with our pretrained models I was amazed by seeing the accuracy it was excellent.<br>
So I find that the pretrained models work best.And you can find all of the keras applications over here:<br>

<br>The credit for the dataset goes to Akash Zade [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ai-engineer-az/] for providing such wonderful dataset.<br>
The dataset can be found in the link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vdr9CC9ChYVW2iXp6PlfyMOGD-4Um1ue
<br> From the keras applications when I tried to use the Inceptionv3 or Resnet50 the accuracy was ok but when I used the Resnet152v2 the accuracy was amazing.
<br>But I think using inceptionv3 would be more better than the resnet152v2, there is no doubt that our resnet152v2 is giving us better accuracy but I would surely suggest that we should use inception model than our resnet as inception has very less number of parameters and it is also giving us a good accuracy so as our parameters of inceptionv3 model are less so the response time is too low and we get a better result in less time.
